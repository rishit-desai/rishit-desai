## Overview

This project focuses on identifying unusual patterns or anomalies in stock price data using Auto-Encoders, a type of neural network. The goal is to detect potential irregularities that might indicate significant market events.

## Key Features

-   **Anomaly Detection**:  Detects anomalies in stock prices using Auto-Encoders.
-   **Historical Data Analysis**:  Analyzes historical stock price data to identify patterns.
-   **Data Visualization**:  Presents anomalies in a clear and intuitive way using Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

-   Python
-   TensorFlow
-   Deep Learning
-   Auto-Encoders
-   Streamlit

## Challenges and Learnings

Building an effective Auto-Encoder model that accurately captures normal stock price behavior and flags anomalies was challenging. I gained significant experience in time series analysis and anomaly detection techniques.

## Outcome

The project provides a tool for identifying potential anomalies in stock prices, which could be valuable for investors or analysts.
