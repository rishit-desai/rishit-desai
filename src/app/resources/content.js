            As a Full Stack Developer Intern at Kenmark ITan, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to design, develop, and deploy innovative web applications. I leveraged Angular for robust front-end development, Node.js for efficient back-end services, Sequelize.js as an Object-Relational Mapper to interact with a MySQL database and implemented responsive web design principles for seamless user experiences across various devices. I actively participated in code reviews, testing, and debugging to maintain high-quality standards. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience in Agile methodologies and contributed to the development of Melo (Music Distribution) and MSC Cruises Job Portal.
